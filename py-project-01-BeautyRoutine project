I think itâ€™s time to explain myself ðŸ™‚ Recently I realized Iâ€™m not getting any younger, so I decided it was finally time to start a skincare routine (girls will get me here ðŸ˜‰). The problem? Twice a day I had to dig through my phone notes to check what exactly to apply on my face. It got frustrating really fast.

Since Iâ€™m a data analyst (not a programmer!), I thought: why not try to automate the process? Donâ€™t expect anything super advanced, but I think it turned out pretty good for a first attempt. Iâ€™ve already converted the script into a Telegram bot, and as I find spare time, Iâ€™ll keep adding improvements and commits here.

Told you this page was going to be fun ðŸ™‚
